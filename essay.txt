During last weeks I’ve been watching videos from previous cdp program. I found that I have gaps in some topics.
Here is the list of topics I would like to refresh/learn deeper :
•	Tdd/clean code
•	Java core
•	Java script
•	Spring framework (IOC + MVC)
•	Continuous integration (jenkins)
•	Build tools (ant, maven)
•	ORM
•	Web services
•	Frontend developing (html + css + js) 
I’m facing with these technologies on my current project. Hope that CDP program will help me with it.
